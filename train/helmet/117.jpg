<h2>The Domain You Requested Has Been Misconfigured</h2>

<p>
CloudFront has detected the DNS record for the domain <span class="DomainName"></span> is misconfigured.  The DNS record for <span class="DomainName">this domain</span> points to CloudFront's IP Range, 
but is not explicitly listed as an Alias for a CloudFront distribution, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#CreatingCNAME">
Adding an Alternate Domain Name</a>.  Due to the misconfiguration we have detected within your DNS and the possibility of another AWS account's ability to utilize 
this domain name to serve malicious content, CloudFront has blocked this domain name from being used.
</p>

<p>
If you own this domain name and would like to associate the Alias to your CloudFront distribution, please follow the article here to get the Alias restored back to 
your distribution: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/resolve-cnamealreadyexists-error/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/resolve-cnamealreadyexists-error/</a>.

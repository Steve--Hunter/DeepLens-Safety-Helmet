Use Case:
As a Site Inspector, I want to identify any construction crew that are not wearing safety helmets, so I can meet my health and safety responsibilties

## Steps:

[1. Download ImageNet images by Wordnet ID](https://github.com/Steve--Hunter/DeepLens-Safety-Helmet/tree/master/1.%20Download%20ImageNet%20images%20by%20Wordnet%20ID.ipynb)

[2. Store images into binary recordIO format for MXNEt](https://github.com/Steve--Hunter/DeepLens-Safety-Helmet/tree/master/2.%20Store%20images%20into%20binary%20recordIO%20format%20for%20MXNEt.ipynb)

[3. Fine tune existing model.ipynb](https://github.com/Steve--Hunter/DeepLens-Safety-Helmet/tree/master/3.%20Fine%20tune%20existing%20model)

[4. Deploy retrained model to DeepLens](https://github.com/Steve--Hunter/DeepLens-Safety-Helmet/tree/master/4.%20Deploy%20retrained%20model%20to%20DeepLens.ipynb)

[5. Alert Site Inspector of construction crew not wearing a safety helmet](https://github.com/Steve--Hunter/DeepLens-Safety-Helmet/tree/master/5.%20Alert%20Site%20Inspector%20of%20construction%20crew%20not%20wearing%20a%20safety%20helmet.ipynb)
